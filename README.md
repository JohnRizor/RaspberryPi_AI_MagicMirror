<h1 align="center">Raspberry Pi Magic Mirror Project</h1>

_____
The purpose of this project was to create a two-way mirror with the ability to display useful informtion for the user. The focus of this application was to allow my mother to view her calendar, the weather forecast, and other informative information. The key feature of the mirror is the screencast function which allows for workout videos and other videos to be displayed on the mirror. New products like the [Mirror] (https://www.mirror.co/) has become a new rave aroung the world. I wanted to provide my mom a similar product she could screencast her iFit, Nike+, and other application workouts on her mirror (without the big tag price). 
____

The current mirror has the following features:
- Calendar
- Date & Time
- Weather Forecast
- Screencast 
- Daily Verse
- News Update
- Alexa Assistant
- Auto Start

Future features I will install:
- Motion Detection

The first step in completing this projects was to do research on completed Magic Mirrors and different modules/scripts that I wanted to install onto the Magic Mirror. The start of my research was at [MagicMirror Builder](https://magicmirror.builders/). 

The following modules and scripts were used to install different features to my mirror.

- [MagicMirror Default](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror)
- [Screencast](https://github.com/kevinatown/MMM-Screencast)
- [Alexa Assistant](https://github.com/dolanmiu/MMM-awesome-alexa)
- [Daily Verse](https://github.com/arthurgarzajr/MMM-DailyBibleVerse)

Future modules I will be installing are:
- [Motion Detection](https://github.com/rejas/MMM-MotionDetector)
- [Google Photo Album](https://github.com/ChrisAcrobat/MMM-GooglePhotos)

Majority of the project was installed using Bash, Javascript, and Python. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) was used to remote into the Raspberry Pi for updates. Below are some photos throughout the progression of my project.

**Connecting the Raspberry Pi to the Mirror**

My goal is to continue to work on the mirror and build a better project. Having the ability to remote into the Pi to conduct installations and updates will be useful to keep the mirror fresh and tailored for the user. Touch up and repaint to improve appearance.
